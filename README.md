# IMPforFCN
This repo is based on the SiftingFeatures repository (https://github.com/phiandark/SiftingFeatures/blob/main/src/IMP_PostProcess.ipynb). 

The main script to run is the IMP.py, which runs Network.py using parameters set by cifar10.ini. You have to download the Cifar10 data set if you don't have it already.
